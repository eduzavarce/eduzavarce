# Hi there, I'm Edu! üëã

<img align="right" alt="Developer GIF" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/M9gbBd9nbDrOTu1Mqx/giphy.gif" width="230px"/>

I'm a Software Developer with a solid foundation in the JavaScript ecosystem, now specializing in **high-quality Backend development with Java and Spring Boot.**

I'm passionate about crafting software that is not only functional but also robust, scalable, and maintainable. This passion drives my focus on learning and applying advanced software architecture principles to solve real-world problems.

---

### üå± What I'm Currently Focusing On

-   **Deepening my expertise in the Spring Ecosystem**, including Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, and WebFlux for reactive services.
-   **Applying software architecture patterns** to my projects, especially Domain-Driven Design (DDD), TDD, and Hexagonal Architecture.
-   **Improving my DevOps skills**, working with Docker for containerization and exploring CI/CD pipelines on Azure.

### üí° My Approach to Software

-   ‚úÖ **Clean Code:** I believe that clean, readable code is the foundation of any successful project.
-   ‚úÖ **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Writing tests first not only ensures reliability but also leads to better and simpler design.
-   ‚úÖ **Domain-Centric Architecture:** I strive to build software that models the business domain accurately, making it more intuitive and resilient to change.
-   ‚úÖ **Continuous Learning:** The tech world is always evolving, and I'm committed to keeping my skills sharp.

### üöÄ Featured Project: Pet-Care Bounded Context

A practical implementation of Domain-Driven Design and Hexagonal Architecture principles.

This project is my personal laboratory for translating software architecture theory into practice. The goal was not to build a complex application, but to focus meticulously on creating a single, well-structured, and decoupled Bounded Context.

**Key Concepts Implemented:**
-   **Domain-Driven Design:** `Bounded Contexts`, `Aggregates`, `Entities`, `Value Objects`, `Domain Events`.
-   **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters):** A clear separation between the application's core logic and its infrastructure concerns.
-   **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Different models to handle reads and writes.
-   **Event-Driven Communication:** Using `RabbitMQ` as a message broker for asynchronous operations.
